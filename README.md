## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:
- **Observations:** 1,460 houses.
- **Features:** 80 features, including:
  - Lot area
  - Overall quality
  - Garage spaces
  - Sale price, and more.

The data is sourced from [Kaggle's Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and serves as an excellent case study for real-world data analysis and modeling.
